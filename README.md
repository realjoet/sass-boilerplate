## Let's Get Started!
To get your Sass working, follow these steps:
  1. Install Sass (on a Mac) 
  ```~ gem install sass```
  2. Get into your styles folder in your directory with terminal
  ```~ cd directory-name/styles```
  3. Run 
  ```~ sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css```
  4. Start writing Sass!

If you need more help installing (or you're not using a Mac), check out the [Sass Installation Guide](http://sass-lang.com/install)
To learn more about how to use Sass, check out the [Sass Learner's Guide](http://sass-lang.com/guide)

Once you have Sass running your terminal should show you any errors you've made in your Sass, which is also an incredible helper.
To shut it down, press control + c when you're done.
