To get your Sass working, follow these steps:
  1. Install Ruby ~ sudo su -c "gem install sass"
  2. Install Sass (on a Mac) ~ gem install sass
  3. cd into your directory [directory-name] in your terminal
  4. cd into styles
  5. run ~ sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css

If you need more help installing, check out the [Sass Installation Guide](http://sass-lang.com/install)
To learn more about how to use Sass, check out the [Sass Learner's Guide](http://sass-lang.com/guide)

Once you have Sass running your terminal should show you any errors you've made in your Sass, which is also an incredible helper.
To shut it down, press control + c when you're done.
